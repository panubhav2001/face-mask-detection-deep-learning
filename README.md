# Mask Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting whether a person in an image is wearing a mask. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is trained on a labeled dataset of images with and without masks. This solution is designed to assist businesses, public authorities, and organizations in monitoring and enforcing mask-wearing regulations, particularly during public health crises.
