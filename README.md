# Mask Detection Project

## Problem Statemet 

In the context of public health and safety, particularly during a pandemic, ensuring compliance with mask-wearing regulations is critical. Organizations and public authorities need an automated, accurate solution to monitor and enforce mask usage in public spaces. The goal is to develop a image recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify whether individuals are wearing masks. This system will help businesses and government agencies efficiently enforce mask policies, reduce the spread of infectious diseases, and maintain public safety.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting whether a person in an image is wearing a mask. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is trained on a labeled dataset of images with and without masks. This solution is designed to assist businesses, public authorities, and organizations in monitoring and enforcing mask-wearing regulations, particularly during public health crises.
